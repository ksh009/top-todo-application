# Features

1. I should have an "Add project button"
2. There should be a grid layout displaying each Project as a card
3. Each Project card should have an update button and delete button. The update button will allow me to add todos for that project and the delete button will allow me to delete my project (Note I cannot delete the project if there are Todos associated with the project)
4. Each project will house the Todos associated to the project
5. When I open my project a list of Todos should appear for the project
6. The Todos table should have the following headers: Date, Description, Completed
7. When I hover over a Todo a delete button should appear which would enable me to delete the Todo
8. On the Todo list there should be a plus button which would enable me to add a Todo (Build of Library project)
9. All todos should be persisted and read from LocalStorage
